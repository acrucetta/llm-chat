## Design Goal

A chat interface where I can write prompts, select models and use tools as appropriate.

## Potential Stack

- Python3, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy
- Use mypy, async/await, and mypy
- Tailwind components

## Features
- Keep chat history
- Retrieve URLs
- Upload files as context
- Create PRs by attaching a codebase?

## Ideas

- Desktop based app
- Local first search
- Branching chats -> initiate a chat using another chat as the base layer a la Obsidian
- Projects
- File uploads
